# Introduction

### Welcome!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to from-the-future. I know the first contribution to a unfamiliar project is hard. But, it is always worth the effort. I created this project to make it easy to collect and view advice for CS students. On top of that, this project is also my "playground" to practice solving common issues in the space of web development and implement whatever related technology that I come across. You are welcome to be part of this and learn from doing.

### What kinds of contributions?

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions.

### Ground Rules
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.

### How to file a bug report.
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

### Process for suggesting a feature.
Raise an issue so that we can discuss a proposed issue.

### Code review process
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before itâ€™s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

### Community
Please use Github issues to communicate any ideas/problems.
